# Contribution
Contribution is welcome, especially in the localisation department;
volunteers to translate a page into a major language are much appreciated.
Adding more game tools, modifications etc. to [Touhou Patches and Tools](https://maribelhearn.com/tools)
is another great way to contribute.

**If you discovered an issue:** report it through [Issues](https://github.com/MaribelHearn/maribelhearn.com/issues), as long as
it has not already been reported.

**If you patched an issue:** create a new pull request with the patch, and make sure the changed code does not conflict with
the established style conventions.

**If you wish to translate content, or contribute to this project in another way:**
please contact `Maribel Hearn#6427` on [Discord](https://www.discordapp.com) to discuss it.
