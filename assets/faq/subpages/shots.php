<h2 id='shots'>Who is the best character / shottype?</h2>
<p>This page lists the different shottypes that exist in each Windows mainline Touhou game, aside from PoFV (Touhou 9).
Some basic information on the shottypes is provided and they are evaluated based on how good they are <em>for a first clear</em>.
Keep in mind that these evaluations do <em>not</em> necessarily translate to different types of goals, such as scoring or a No Bombs clear.</p>
<p>In Touhou 7 to 15, Reimu has a smaller hitbox than other characters, as well as Yukari in IN (Touhou 8), but this is <em>almost irrelevant</em> for a first 1cc.</p>
