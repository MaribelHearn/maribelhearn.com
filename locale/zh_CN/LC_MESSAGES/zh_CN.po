"Lyrica's scope is similar to Marisa's, but is much harder to use due to her "

"Her focused movement speed is barely different from her normal speed. This "
"is strictly a weakness: she's too fast for precision, while also being too "
"slow for anything else. The scope is awkward. The charge attack is even more "
"useless than Reimu's. She is subject to a strange glitch; her time stop ends "
"the bullet clearing effect of her spells. The result is that both the level "

"Additionally, should you cast a level 2 just before an automatic level 3 "

"spawns very few bullets that also appear all at once; this makes it easy for "
