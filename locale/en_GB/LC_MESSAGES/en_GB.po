"The <strong>Dodging Rain Competition (DRC)</strong> is a Touhou game "
"competition that was devised by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/"
"mariomaster657\">ZM</a> and is held on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Ucae3Uf"
"\">the official DRC Discord</a>. Two teams go up against each other in "
"several different categories. Each player posts an arbitrarily long list of "
"categories, ordered by preference, which can be either survival or scoring "
"of any Touhou shooting game and any difficulty. They will be matched up "
"against a player from the other team, in a category that both players had on "
"their list. The teams and categories are determined by the DRC management "
"team. Players are given two weeks to sign up for the competition, and once "
"it starts, two weeks to submit a replay, which will be awarded points "
"dependent on the rubrics. Runs done outside those two weeks are invalid. "
"Players can submit an unlimited number of replays; the replay that is worth "
"the most DRC points will count."
