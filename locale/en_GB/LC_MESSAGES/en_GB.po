"Her focused movement speed is barely different from her normal speed. This "
"is strictly a weakness: she's too fast for precision, while also being too "
"slow for anything else. The scope is awkward. The charge attack is even more "
"useless than Reimu's. She is subject to a strange glitch; her time stop ends "
"the bullet clearing effect of her spells. The result is that both the level "
"2 and level 3 spells clear the same area on her field, and this area is "
"smaller than the area a normal character's level 2 would clear. "
"Additionally, should you cast a level 2 just before an automatic level 3 "
"occurs (through spell points reaching 500k) the time stop will cut it short "
"instantaneously, and it will clear no bullets at all. The time stop can also "
"toy with enemy spells, causing bullets which should have spawned over time "
"to spawn all at once (for instance, Aya's spell can become a blanket across "
"the whole screen). This is yet another weakness in many cases, as it can "
"lead to unpredictable things, though arguably it could be advantageous in "
"some cases. Her spell itself is not threatening to the opponent, since it "
"spawns very few bullets that also appear all at once; this makes it easy for "
"the opponent to clear it away with their own spell. In fact, it can often be "
"cleared by a spell that was cast before the bullets even appeared. The knife "
"rows can limit the opponent's movement but are very slow and become a non-"
"issue, as spells are cast more frequently as the match progresses. The boss "
