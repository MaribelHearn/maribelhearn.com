    <p>Touhou Puppet Play, commonly known as Touhoumon, is a series of Pokemon fangames that replaces the Pokemon with Touhou characters. They are referred to as Puppets in-game,
    hence the name Touhou Puppet Play (Japanese: 東方人形劇 <em>touhou ningyougeki</em>). Most of the games are romhacks of Generation 3 Pokemon titles.</p>
    <p>Touhou Puppet Dance Performance, or TPDP for short, is a spiritual successor to Touhou Puppet Play. Known in Japanese as 幻想人形演舞 <em>gensou ningyou enbu</em>, it is a fangame that was developed from scratch rather than being a romhack.</p>
